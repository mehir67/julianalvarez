      <td width="219"><p>Julián Alvarez (born 31 January 2000) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for La Liga club Atlético Madrid and the Argentina national team.</p>
        <p>Alvarez began his football career in his native Argentina, where he was an academy graduate of River Plate, making his first-team debut for the club in 2018. There, he spent four seasons and won the Copa Argentina, 2018 Copa Libertadores and the Argentine Primera División in 2021, finishing as the competition's top scorer. He was named the South American Footballer of the Year in 2021. He was signed by Manchester City in 2022, winning a treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in his debut campaign, before leaving for Atlético Madrid in 2024 in a club-record departure deal worth up to €95 million.</p>
        <p>Alvarez previously represented Argentina at various youth levels, competing at the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup and 2020 CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament. He made his senior international debut in 2021, and played for the squads that won the 2021 Copa América, the 2022 Finalissima, the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and the 2024 Copa América.</p>
      <p>Alvarez's nickname is &quot;La Araña&quot; (the spider) or &quot;El Hombre Araña&quot; (Spider-Man), reflecting his web-shooter goal celebration.</p></td>

      <td><h2>SYLE OF PLAY</h2>
        <p>Alvarez is a versatile forward who can play anywhere on the front line.He is direct, quick, and has graceful control with his right foot, oftenconverting awkward chances. Alvarez is also a good link-up player, with the technique and vision to play quick passes and one-touch football.Playing against rough South American tacklers, his dribbling and ability to manoeuvre in tight spaces are sublime. Alvarez is also a very hardworking player, running around off the ball and capable of leading a strong press.</p>
        <p>Alvarez's first touch is incredibly composed and always intentional, with him capable of both killing a ball dead or nudging it away from a defender and into his own path. While not a particularly skillful dribbler, Alvarez is a powerful runner. His slightly hunched running style allows him to barrel through challenges and protect the ball effectively, and there is a tenacity and doggedness to his carrying that makes him difficult to stop. Alvarez is used to playing in a two-striker system in a team with an extremely settled style of play.</p>
      <p>In the 2023–24 season, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola often used Alvarez as an attacking midfielder in the absence of Kevin De Bruyne. Alvarez's intelligent running, passing and possession has led to him thriving in this position, and he has often been lauded by pundits for successfully adapting to the requirements of the new position.</p></td>
